1. Fill in your username and password in credentials.properties
2. mvn assembly:assembly
3. java -jar EodQuote-xxx.jar

Finally I can connect and login to EodData.com wsdl service at http://ws.eoddata.com/data.asmx?wsdl to retrieve intraday historical data.

The xml at http://ws.eoddata.com/data.asmx?wsdl contains LoginResponse element and LOGINRESPONSE complexType,

so if you use wsdl2java (apache-cxf-2.2.9) to generate the java classes, it will only generate one class LoginResponse, and ignore LOGINRESPONSE ( as it is not valid to have 2 classes with the same name in java)

To get around this,

- save the wsdl locally

- rename LOGINRESPONSE into LOGINRESPONSE2 in the wsdl file

- ./wsdl2java  -client -d client  /Users/lydonchandra/java/EodQuote/EodQuote/src/main/resources/eod.xml

This should generate the package com.eoddata.ws.data into client dir, and you just need to copy it into your project.

Then from your java

Data data = new Data();

Object obj = data.getDataSoap().login("username-without-email-address", "password");

If you are a platinum member, you should be able to login!.
